            Our solar system has five dwarf planets. In order of distance from the Sun they are: Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris. <br><br><br>
            Pluto and other dwarf planets are a lot like regular planets. So what’s the big difference? The International Astronomical Union (IAU), a world organization of astronomers, came up with the definition of a planet in 2006. According to the IAU, a planet must do three things: <br><br><br>
            Pluto is by far the most famous dwarf planet. Discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930, Pluto was long considered our solar system's ninth planet. But after other astronomers found similar intriguing worlds deeper in the distant Kuiper Belt – the IAU reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006.

    <div class="flex justify-center mt-[70px]">
        <p class="text-white text-[17.6px] w-[1000px]">There was widespread outrage on behalf of the demoted planet. Textbooks were updated, and the internet spawned memes with Pluto going through a range of emotions, from anger to loneliness.
            On July 14, 2015, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft made its historic flight through the Pluto system – providing the first close-up images of Pluto and its moons and collecting other data that has transformed our understanding of these mysterious worlds on the solar system’s outer frontier. <br><br>
            Dwarf planet Ceres is closer to home. Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and it's the only dwarf planet located in the inner solar system. Like Pluto, Ceres also was once classified as a planet. Ceres was the first dwarf planet to be visited by a spacecraft – NASA’s Dawn mission.

            The Orion Nebula, also known as Messier 42, is a stellar nursery in the constellation Orion, about 1,344 light years from Earth. It's a diffuse nebula located in the Milky Way, south of Orion's Belt, and is known as the middle "star" in the "sword" of Orion. The Orion Nebula is one of the brightest nebulae and is visible to the naked eye in the night sky with an apparent magnitude of 4.0 <br><br>
            The Orion Nebula was discovered on November 26, 1610 by Christiaan Huygens. The Maya of Mesoamerica believed the Orion Nebula to be the cosmic fire of creation.

            The Orion Nebula is a tumultuous region of dust and gas where thousands of stars are being born. It's the closest large star-forming region to Earth, and astronomers have a clear view into this crowded stellar maternity ward because massive stars in the center of the nebula have blown out most of the dust and gas in which they formed. The nebula's features, such as arcs, blobs, pillars, and rings of dust that resemble cigar smoke, print the entire star formation history of Orion.

            Black hole</h1>

            A black hole is a region in space where a large amount of mass is packed into a very small volume, creating a gravitational pull so strong that nothing, including light, can escape. <br><br><br>
            Black holes are usually the collapsed core of a massive star that has exploded in a supernova. During the star's life, nuclear fusion creates an outward push that balances the inward pull of gravity from the star's mass. After the star explodes, there are no longer forces to oppose gravity, so the core begins to collapse in on itself. If the mass collapses into an infinitely small point, a black hole is born.

    <div class="flex justify-center mt-[70px]">
        <p class="text-white text-[17.6px] w-[1000px]">Black holes are invisible because they emit almost no light. However, scientists can find them by looking for things that are falling into them. The presence of a black hole can also be inferred through its interaction with other matter and electromagnetic radiation. 
            Black holes can range in size from tiny structures that are about the size of a human cell to enormous giants that are billions of times more massive than the sun. Astronomers have identified three types of black holes: stellar, supermassive, and intermediate. Stellar black holes are usually about 10 solar masses, while supermassive black holes can be millions or even billions of times the mass of the sun
